  	<h2>2022-07-21</h2>
	<p>There's something about the act of sharing music with others that cannot be put to words. That muscle has atrophied for me. I used to play shows, organize music events, put music up online, jam with friends. Not so much of that lately. Just fiddling on the guitar and learning pieces.</p>
	<p>There's still that desire to share, so I'm trying to do this by creating a sort of <a href="https://ceej.ichi.city/sounds.html">music corner</a> where I'll put up recordings of pieces I'm learning and perhaps some of the fiddling too. Music is still a part of me, not just an atrophying muscle</p>
