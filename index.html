	<p>I've been trying to read multiple books at the same time. There's something about bouncing between books that can create an intersection of thought and feeling wholly unique. Difficult to even replicate with a social feed.</p>
	<p>Currently the books in conversation are David Wengrow and David Graeber's <i>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity</i>, James Bridle's <i>Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for Planetary Intelligence</i>, and Mark Fisher's <i>Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?</i>.</p>
